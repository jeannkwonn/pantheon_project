# Pantheon Project: Historical Popularity Index

Pantheon project is a dataset of historically significant figures from around the world. The validity of these figures are measured in two criteria.
  1. Article languages measure the number of different Wikipedia language editions that have an article about the historical figure.
  2. Historical popularity index corrects Article languages by adding information on the age of the historical character, the concentration of page views among different languages, the coefficient of variation in page views, and the number of page views in languages other than English.

There are 11328 figures in this dataset.
